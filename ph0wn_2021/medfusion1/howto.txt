The challenge is a pentest against a how:
medfusion.ph0wn.org

this is hosting a medical pump.

First, we can scan the host's available service with nmap:
nmap medfusion.ph0wn.org

This shows 3 open ports with a FTP (21), telnet (23) and "cdt" (7777) services.

We need to find a way to exploit one of these services to get access to the flag.

Let's start with the FTP.
We can run an anonymous exploit scan with metasploit.
This shows the Anonymous user has Read/Write access.

We can login with following command:
ftp medfusion.ph0wn.org

Creds: anonymous:anonymous

Once logged, we can try to read from the host with "ls".
We observe the commands hangs.
The subtility here is to use ftp in passive mode:
ftp --passive
or :
pftp

This time we can read from the host.
It contains a CONFIG.XML file.
Little wget command on that and we retrieved the file.
When opening it, we get a username and password for the port 23:

<Medfusion3600Configuration>
<TelnetInterface>
<Port>23</Port>
<Username>medfusion</Username>
<Password>chu_ph0wn</Password>
</TelnetInterface>
</Medfusion3600Configuration>

We can get access to the telnet service running on port 23.
There, we'll find the flag for the first part of the challenge, and the base information for the part 2.
